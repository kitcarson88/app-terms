## Privacy Policy

Welcome to the "Gioco del tris - TicTacToe" app policies page. The app is available for the download on the Google Play Store.

I hereby state, to the best of my knowledge and belief, that I have not programmed this app to collect any personally identifiable information. All app data preferences (like sounds availability, and players' nicknames) created by the user are stored on the device only, and can be simply erased by clearing the app's data or uninstalling it.

The application does not require the acceptance of any kind of permission from the user, and it is designed exclusively for a playful purpose in single player mode, or in local multiplayer on the same device.

If you find any security vulnerability that has been inadvertently caused by me, or have any question regarding how the app protectes your privacy, please send me an email, and I will surely try to fix it/help you.

Best regards,
Simone Colazzo
